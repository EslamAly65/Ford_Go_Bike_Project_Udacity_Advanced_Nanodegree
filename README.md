## by Eslam Aly


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is a bike share system located in the Bay Area, more specifically in San Francisco, East Bay, and San Jose. With 7,000 bikes distributed across those 3 regions, customers have the feasibility to unlock bikes from one station and return to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips.

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in Ford GoBike system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in 2018.


## Summary of Findings

. The trip durations in sec is right skewed with a peak of around 500 (noting that the median calculated above is 510).
. The data has a maximum of trip durations of 84,548 sec = 23 hrs, which is a very large duration. So, i excluded large durations (more than 3000 sec = 50 mins).
. The subscribers are the most of the users, which is logic as most probably, the application requires first for a user to make an account.
. Males are more frequent to use bikes as a transportation method.
. Most of the trips durations are made by people of age between 17 and 40 years.
. The customer user types are making higher trip durations than the subscribers, this could be because the customers are just trying the system so they need to get the most benefit of the experience. Unlike the subscribers who are usually using the system during their routine (short trips).
. Surprisingly, the females are making slightly higher durations than men drivers.
. Men drivers are higher in age compared with females.

## Key Insights for Presentation

. Men with high age are making higher trip durations more than females with high age.
. In low age comparison, the number are mostly the same.
. Female customrs are making higher durations than male customers and all subscribers.
. Female subscribers are making higher durations than male subscribers.
. My increasing tendency is even more increased. Even males counts is much higher than females, the females drivers are making higher trips than men whether they are customers or subscribers.
